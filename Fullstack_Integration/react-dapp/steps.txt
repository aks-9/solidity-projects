Open a new terminal in the app's folder and run:
npx hardhat node


Then deploy the contract by running:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

Copy the deployed address and update it in the App.js

Open another new terminal in the app's folder and run:
npm start

From the first terminal, where node was created, copy the private key of one of the addresses and import it in metamask.

Connect, sign the transactions and you will be able to make changes.
